              When we talk about state in our applications, itâ€™s important to be clear about what types of state actually matter.

There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:Local state,Global state,Server state,UR state

              Simply put, prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype

              The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.

              React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue. js is a progressive framework. They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they're not 100 percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences.
